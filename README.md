<h1>Purpose of publication</h1>
<h3>The reason for making IMP open source and publishing it is to let you know more about IMP and to find holes in IMP. If you are a great person, can you make IMP great with your help? However, since this is a Mit License, it is allowed to be reused. In other words, you can make your language imitate IMP, or add new features!</h3>
<h1>How to use!!!</h1>
<h3>Line 6 contains a field that specifies the executable file path for the IMP file. The extension of this path is for files that are not binary and are stored in UTF-8.</h3>

<h3>The IMP reference is currently in preparation, but you can see the code that IMP has with <b><code>help();</code></b>. You can also search within the help function by entering the function name in the argument of the help function.</h3>
